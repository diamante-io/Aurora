# Experimental packages

Packages contained within this folder are considered experimental, and may be buggy or broken.  This provides a location where developers can experiment with new APIs, 

See [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/diamnet/go/exp) for details about each package.

## Adding experimental services, clients, tools, etc.

Just as with the non-experimental portion of this repo, the `exp` package uses a well-defined package structure for a few common activities.  An experimental service would go in `github.com/diamnet/go/exp/services`, for example.
