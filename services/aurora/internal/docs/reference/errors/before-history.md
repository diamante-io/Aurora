title: Before History
---

A aurora server may be configured to only keep a portion of the diamnet network's history stored
within its database.  This error will be returned when a client requests a piece of information
(such as a page of transactions or a single operation) that the server can positively identify as
falling outside the range of recorded history.

This error returns a
[HTTP 410 Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Response_codes).
