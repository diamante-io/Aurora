title: Timeout
replacement: https://developers.diamnet.org/api/errors/http-status-codes/aurora-specific/
---

If you are encountering this error it means that either:

* Aurora has not received a confirmation from the Diamnet Core server that the transaction you are
  trying to submit to the network was included in a ledger in a timely manner.
* Aurora has not sent a response to a reverse-proxy before a specified amount of time has elapsed.

The former case may happen because there was no room for your transaction for 3 consecutive
ledgers. This is because Diamnet Core removes each submitted transaction from a queue. To solve
this you can:

* Keep resubmitting the same transaction (with the same sequence number) and wait until it finally
  is added to a new ledger.
* Increase the [fee](../../../guides/concepts/fees.md) in order to prioritize the transaction.

This error returns a
[HTTP 504 Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Response_codes).
