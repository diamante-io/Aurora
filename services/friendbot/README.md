# Friendbot Service for the Diamnet Test Network

Friendbot helps users of the Diamnet testnet by exposing a REST endpoint that creates & funds new accounts.

Aurora needs to be started with the following command line param: --friendbot-url="http://localhost:8004/"
This will forward any query params received against /friendbot to the friendbot instance.
The ideal setup for aurora is to proxy all requests to the /friendbot url to the friendbot service
